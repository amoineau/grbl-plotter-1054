## History
Needs to be read from the bottom up ;-)  

### 2020-07-23 Version 1.5.0.0    
Revision of the graphical import algorithms:   
* grouping by pen-color, pen-width, layer-name
* clipping, tiling [Setup - Graphics import - Path import - Clipping](issue #109)
* sort objects by shortest connections [Setup - Graphics import - Path import - General Options](issue #119)
* merge / append almost connected paths (issue #121)
* path repetition optionally path by path [Setup - Graphics import - Path import - General Options]
* hatch fill of closed paths [Setup - Graphics import - Path import - Path modifications](issue #124)
* path extension of closed path for laser cutting
* path interpretation: translate pen-width to Z-value [Setup - Graphics import - Path import - General options](issue #127)
  
New features:    
* import of CSV data (like airfoil data from: https://m-selig.ae.illinois.edu/ads/coord_database.html)

### 2015-09 Start of GRBL-Plotter
After struggeling with an other GCode sender (just working when logged-in as admin) and missing features,
I started my own GCode sender. 
My main use is 2.5D usage for a CNC router and a plotter.  
The most disturbing points were:  
* no automatic reconnect, when starting the program
* no automatic set of the feed rate, when moving the stage the first time
* poor manual control (joystick) via user interface
